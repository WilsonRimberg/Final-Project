## Functional Specification

This document should become the functional specification of the project you are working on.

A functional specification describes in great detail how a device or program will appear to an
outside user. That is, it treats all hardware as a "black box", the contents of which are completely
unknown to the user. The functional specification should include sections with the following information:

Your specification **should include** the following types of information:

Summary: My program will be a 90s RPG in the form of one of the original Dragon Quests, Final Fantasies, or Chrono Trigger. Basically, the player is an automatically generated player (can't customize appearence) who can wander through various zones, fights enemies, etc. Therre will hopefully be some sort of loot system, but whether or not that system will actually do anything is up in the air.

Method of Sharing: The program will be shared through Runpython

Graphic Screens: The first graphic scene will be of the main character's house, where they will start the game. The second part graphic screen will be of the world outside that will lead the main character to a potato chip factory is the third screen. In this screen, the player character will die if they touch any of the walls that will be rendered along with the screen. The final backgrounds are winning and losing screens that trigger depending on whether or not the player wins or loses

Inputs: For the the first three graphics screens, the player will press keys to make the player move and maybe press return to interact with some objects (like doors). WASD will be used to move. In the winning/losing screens, the player will use the 'tab' button to restart the game if they so choose.

Mouse Input: Nope

Keyboard input: Yes, arrow keys or WASD to move. Tab to restart.

Graphical Assets: Main character, walls, a door, a catle/house, a factory, factory floors, stairs, and a bag of potato chips

Installation: Nope

Your specification should **not** include the following types of information:

* The language you will use to create it.
* Names of any specific files in the project.
* How you will structure the classes, functions and code in your program.
* The name of any files or tools that you will use to design the program.

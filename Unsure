## Functional Specification

This document should become the functional specification of the project you are working on.

A functional specification describes in great detail how a device or program will appear to an
outside user. That is, it treats all hardware as a "black box", the contents of which are completely
unknown to the user. The functional specification should include sections with the following information:

Your specification **should include** the following types of information:

Summary: My program will be a 90s RPG in the form of one of the original Dragon Quests, Final Fantasies, or Chrono Trigger. Basically, the player is an automatically generated player (can't customize appearence) who can wander through various zones, fights enemies, etc. Therre will hopefully be some sort of loot system, but whether or not that system will actually do anything is up in the air.

Method of Sharing: The program will be shared through Run

Graphic Screens: The first graphic scene will be of the main character's house, where they will start the game. The second part graphic screen will be some sort of world outside the house (maybe an island) that will lead the main character to some sort of dungeon the third screen. The final screen will be some sort of combat screen for when the player fights enemies in the dungeon.

Inputs: For the the first three graphics screens, the player will press keys to make the player move and maybe press return to interact with some objects (like doors). In the fourth screen, the player will use the mouse to select attack options (and maybe spells) to defeat the enemies.

Mouse Input: Yes, see above

Keyboard input: Yes, arrow keys or WASD to move. Return to interact with objects (maybe)

Graphical Assets: Main character, a few enemies, maybe some environs

Installation: Nope

Your specification should **not** include the following types of information:

* The language you will use to create it.
* Names of any specific files in the project.
* How you will structure the classes, functions and code in your program.
* The name of any files or tools that you will use to design the program.

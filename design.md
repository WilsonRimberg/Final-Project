## Design Specification

The design specificaiton is a counterpart to the Functional Speciffication. Where a functional specification concerns itself
with inputs and outputs from the program, or the *experience* of a user running the program, the design specification is concerned with decisions that the engineer and programmer must make during its creation.

Tools and Frameworks: Runpython, ggame, maybe some other stuff

Language: Python

Code to support:
Code to display the images, code to limit walking in certain areas, code to enter areas, code to switch areas to do movement, code to restart, code that causes death or victory.

* What data will be stored or manipulated by the program? How will it be encoded and organized? 
The program will store the character's location, which screen they are on, if any win conditions have been met, if the character is dead 

* Describe the logic and/or code behind every interaction with the user, and behind everything displayed. 
Interactions will be based off of sprite detection, maybe a few annimations, etc. Sprite detection will be critical, as it will determine when fights begin, what area the player is in, and will also be how animations work. 

* If your program uses an unusual or notable *algorithm*, what is the algorithm and how does it work? Wub

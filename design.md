## Design Specification

The design specificaiton is a counterpart to the Functional Speciffication. Where a functional specification concerns itself
with inputs and outputs from the program, or the *experience* of a user running the program, the design specification is concerned with decisions that the engineer and programmer must make during its creation.

The design specification should include information like:

Tools and Frameworks: Runpython, ggame, maybe some other stuff

Language: Python

Code to support:
Code to display the images, code to limit walking in certain areas, code to enter the screen code to do movement, code to handle damage

* What data will be stored or manipulated by the program? How will it be encoded and organized? Wub
* Describe the logic and/or code behind every interaction with the user, and behind everything displayed. Wub
* If your program uses an unusual or notable *algorithm*, what is the algorithm and how does it work? Wub
